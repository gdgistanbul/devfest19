Canary deployments is one of the techniques in Progressive Delivery, used in companies like Facebook to roll out new versions gradually. But good news! you don't need to be Facebook to take advantage of it.\n\nWe will demo how to create a fully automated Progressive Delivery pipeline with Canary deployments and rollbacks in Kubernetes using Jenkins X, an open source platform for cloud native CI/CD in Kubernetes, and Flagger, a project that uses Istio and Prometheus to automate Canary rollouts and rollbacks.",
